    <h1>PHOTHOSYNTHESIS</h1>
    <h3>Photosynthesis is how plants use light energy to power their growth.
        They serve as an energy source for life on Earth and therefore plants
        are a vital part of our lives
    </h3>
    <div class="box_l"><b>The Process</b><br>
        - During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2)
        and water (H2O) from the air and soil.<br>
        - Within the plant cell,the water is oxidized, meaning it loses
        electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains
        electrons.<br>
        - This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide
        into glucose.<br>
        - The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores
        energy within the glucose molecules.
    </div>
    <div class="box_r"><b>Chlorophyll</b><br>
        - Inside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts,
        which store the energy of sunlight.<br>
        - Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a light-absorbing
        pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving the plant
        its green color.<br>
        - During photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs energy from blue- and
        red-light waves, and reflects green-light waves, making the plant
        appear green.

    <div class="box_l"><b>Light Reactions</b><br>
        - Light energy from the &quot;SUN&quot; if converted to chemical energy
        through a series of complex chemical reactions. The ultimate beginning and
        end products are:<br>
        6 CO<sup>2</sup> + 6 H<sup>2</sup>O &rightarrow; C<sup>6</sup>H<sup>2</sup>
        O<sup>2</sup> + 6 O<sup>2</sup><br>
        - So plants start with carbon dioxide and water and in return we get carbohydrates
        and oxygen.

    </div>
    <div class="box_r"><b>Why are plants green?</b><br>
        Plants are green because of light absorbing pigments called &quot;Chlorophyll&quot;.<br>
        They absorb mostly red (650mm) and blue (430mm) light wavelengths and reflect green,
        which is what our eyes see.
